OpenIO SDS is a scalable open-source object storage solution. It is compatible with Amazon S3 and OpenStack Swift. Using OpenIO SDS, it is easy to scale a storage infrastructure from a simple cluster of a few terabytes to a multi-petabyte platform. OpenIO SDS is hardware-agnostic and can be installed on both x86 and ARM hardware.
