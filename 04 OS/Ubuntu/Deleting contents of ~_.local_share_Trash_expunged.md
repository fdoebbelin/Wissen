Is there a safe way of deleting contents of `~/.local/share/Trash/expunged` ? I see It has lots of files & folders I had deleted -- from the trash as well. They are taking a lot of disc space.

After deleting the files & clearing the trash why are the files still there ?

I haven't tried it yet but is it ok to manually delete them ?

```
  sudo rm -rv ~/.local/share/Trash/expunged

```
