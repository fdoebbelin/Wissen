## Installing Chromium in Ubuntu

If you are okay with using commands, you can simply type this in the terminal:

```
sudo apt install -y chromium-browser
```

If you are not comfortable with terminal, donâ€™t worry. In Ubuntu (as well as in other distributions), you can find Chromium in the Software Center. Open up Software Center and search for Chromium:

![Ubuntu Software Center Chromium](_resources/ubuntu_software_center_chromium.jpg)

Ubuntu Software Center Chromium

Click on the entry and then on Install:

![Ubuntu Software Center Install Chromium](_resources/ubuntu_software_center_install_c.png)

Ubuntu Software Center Install Chromium

You can now open Chromium by searching for it in the Applications menu:

![Ubuntu Applications Chromium](_resources/ubuntu_applications_chromium.jpg)

Ubuntu Applications Chromium

or by opening up a terminal and typing in:

```
chromium
```

You can uninstall the app the same way you installed it (from the Software Center).
