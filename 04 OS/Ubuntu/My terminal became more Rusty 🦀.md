As a Software-Engineer I spent most of the time inside my terminal, So  
I need for that a fast terminal with fast tools to speed up my productivity.

The tools written in rust help me to achieve that. letâ€™s see in this article  
those tools.

### [ðŸ”—](#h-alacritty) Alacritty

Letâ€™s start our list with alacritty terminal is one of the fastest terminals  
because of using GPU for rendering, and it is a cross-platform terminal.

You can customize your own configuration like color scheme, fonts, opacity, and key mapping.

Alacritty doesnâ€™t come with ligature support but you can use  
this [fork](https://github.com/zenixls2/alacritty/tree/ligature). or if  
you are using Arch you can install it from [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alacritty-ligatures/)

### [ðŸ”—](#h-starship) Starship

I used to use zsh + powerlevel9k as my prompt and even when I migrate to powerlevel10k, I still  
notice a delay when open new shell. But with starship itâ€™s start instantly.

You can use it with any shell bash, zsh, fish and even powerShell.

The screenshot below showing the result of my customized configuration.

### [ðŸ”—](#h-exa) Exa

exa is an implementation of `ls` command but with colors and icons and it renders very fast.

Iâ€™m using exa as replacer for ls command by making an alias.

```
if [ "$(command -v exa)" ]; then    unalias -m 'll'    unalias -m 'l'    unalias -m 'la'    unalias -m 'ls'    alias ls='exa -G  --color auto --icons -a -s type'    alias ll='exa -l --color always --icons -a -s type'fi
```

the result of my `ls` and `ll` commands.

### [ðŸ”—](#h-bat) Bat

Bat is an implementation for `cat` command but with syntax highlighted.

Also I make an alias for this command with nord theme.

```
if [ "$(command -v bat)" ]; then  unalias -m 'cat'  alias cat='bat -pp --theme="Nord"'fi
```

### [ðŸ”—](#h-delta) Delta

delta enhance your git diff output by adding some cool features like syntax highlighting,  
line numbering, and side-by-side view.

to make delta works in your `.gitconfig` file add:

```
[core]  pager = delta[interactive]  diffFilter = delta --color-only[delta]  side-by-side = true  line-numbers-left-format = ""  line-numbers-right-format = "â”‚ "  syntax-theme = Nord
```

we set `delta` as the default pager for git commands output and enable side-by-side  
feature and set a theme for Nord, You can choose your preferred theme run and choose one.

```
delta --list-syntax-themes
```

### [ðŸ”—](#h-zoxide) Zoxide

I donâ€™t use any file explorer, I just use `cd` command to navigate between the files and `ls` commands.

I have a `projects` directory on my home folder if I wanna navigate to a project of those projects.  
I will write

```
cd ~/projects/mahmoudashraf.dev
```

instead I will write

```
z ~/projects/mahmoudashraf.dev
```

just to the first time and if I wanna navigate again to this directory from anywhere  
just write

```
z mah
```

### [ðŸ”—](#h-ripgrep) Ripgrep

It is a cross-platform command line searches your directory for a regex pattern.

I recommend you read this article [ripgrep is faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift}](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

some commands that iâ€™m using

```
rg tjs "import React"rg "\.content" -g "*.pug"rg fast README.md --replace FAST
```

### [ðŸ”—](#h-fd) Fd

the friendly version of `find` command, and faster.

Itâ€™s by default ignore `.gitignore` file

in this tutorial I have some screenshots in `png` format to convert them all to `jpeg`:

```
fd -e png -x convert {} {.}.jpeg
```

To delete files

```
fd -H '^\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm
```

### [ðŸ”—](#h-bottom) bottom

In this time not `top` ðŸ˜€ it is `bottom`

itâ€™s a cross-platform system monitor.

### [ðŸ”—](#h-tldr-2) Tldr

tldr is a cheatsheets for CLIs, instead of read the whole `man`.

### [ðŸ”—](#h-more-tools%3F) More Tools?

- for who want lightweight alternative for spotify client you can use `spotify-tui`.
- also if you prefer an UI interface for git check `gitui`.

and there is a ton of CLIs and tools written in rust you can check
