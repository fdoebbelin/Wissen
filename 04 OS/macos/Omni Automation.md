## Overview

“Omni Automation” is the name of the comprehensive user-controlled automation tools included with the productivity suite of applications from The Omni Group: OmniGraffle, OmniOutliner, OmniPlan, and OmniFocus.

Using the [Core JavaScript language](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore), Omni Automation “scripts” offer the same syntax and functionality across all Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, and macOS). For example, a JavaScript script written to automate an OmniFocus process will execute the same regardless of which Apple device is hosting the application.

In addition, Omni Automation provides built-in tools for communicating with other Omni and 3rd-party applications, using standard “URL [callbacks](http://x-callback-url.com/);” integrated HTTP-Request support for accessing remote sources via RESTful APIs; and the secure storage of credentials.

To maximize portability, Omni Automation scripts can be saved as text-based “Plug-Ins” installable by the user and which may be shared between devices via iCloud and 3rd-party internet storage integration.

And to best enable user-interaction, these plug-in “action” files can present standard application interfaces, like text fields, checkboxes, and menus, to enable the user to provide input to best guide the script as it processes data and automates application features.

- **included with each Omni application**, covering nearly all application features, and is supported by extensive API documentation available on this website.
    
- **Uses the** [Core JavaScript](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) component of the open-source [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) frameworks, one of the most widely used, documented, and optimized scripting languages there is.
    
- **user-configurable and user-installable**. Omni Automation plug-ins may be shared between devices and platforms using shared internet services such as DropBox and Apple’s iCloud Drive.
    
- **compatible with 3rd-party applications** that support JavaScript and standard URL callbacks.
    
- **designed to interact fully with the Shortcuts automation workflows application**, which is included by default with iOS and iPadOS.
    
- **text-based**. Although each Omni application includes a built-in console for writing and running user-input scripts, Omni Automation is fully compatible with 3rd-party code editing applications, which can be used to author the automation action files.
    
- **a community of motivated users** who use Omni Automation to create and distribute custom productivity tools for automating both common and uncommon processes and procedures.
