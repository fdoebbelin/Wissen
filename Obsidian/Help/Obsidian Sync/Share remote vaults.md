Learn how to share a remote vault with another user.

Collaborators need an active Obsidian Sync subscription to access a shared vault. Joining a shared remote vault doesn't count towards your [vault limit](Limitations#How%20many%20remote%20vaults%20can%20I%20have?).

Except for adding new collaborators, collaborators receive the same permissions as the vault owner. Fine-grained permissions are not supported.

If the remote vault is [end-to-end encrypted](Obsidian%20Sync/Security%20and%20privacy.md), collaborators need to enter the encryption password when they set up the vault.

> Avoid working on the same note at the same time as it may lead to changes being lost during the sync process.
