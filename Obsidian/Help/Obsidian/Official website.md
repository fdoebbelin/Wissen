Obsidian’s official website is at https://obsidian.md/.

It’s useful for:

1. Grabbing the latest installer if your installer version is too old;
2. Register an account if you want to purchase [Catalyst license](Catalyst%20license.md), [Commercial license](Commercial%20license.md), [Obsidian Sync](Introduction%20to%20Obsidian%20Sync.md), or [Obsidian Publish](Obsidian%20Publish);
3. Playing a [quiz game](https://obsidian.md/quiz) if you’re confident with your knowledge of the community plugins and themes.
