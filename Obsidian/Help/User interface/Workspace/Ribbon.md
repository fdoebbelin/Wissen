The ribbon is a space for common commands that occupies the vertical space at the very left of the interface. Itâ€™s part of the left [Sidebar](Sidebar.md) and is always visible, even if the left sidebar is closed.

## Actions

Each action is presented by an icon in the ribbon. Hovering them will present a tooltip; clicking or tapping them will activate the action.

The top ones are added by plugins, both [core plugins](Core%20plugins.md) and [Community plugins](Community%20plugins.md).

The bottom three actions are Obsidian system actions to:

1. Open another vault;
2. Get help (opens [help vault](help%20vault) on the [desktop app](desktop%20app) and opens [online help](online%20help) in the mobile app);
3. Open settings.
