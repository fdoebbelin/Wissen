1.  **Side-to-Side Steps**
    -   Start standing on the [balance pad](https://www.prosourcefit.com/collections/best-sellers/products/exercise-balance-pad "ProSource Balance Pad") with feet close together.
    -   Shift your weight entirely onto your right foot and slowly lift your left leg off the pad. Hold for 3-4 seconds, then put your left down.
    -   As soon as the left leg touches the pad, transfer your weight to that foot and lift your right leg.
    -   Repeat 5-10 times on each side.![mature woman doing side to side steps on prosourcefit balance pad](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0916/1708/files/blog_image_1_FIT.jpg?v=1553896326)

3.  **March in Place**
    -   Start standing on the balance pad with feet close together.
    -   Start marching, lifting one foot at a time as high as you comfortably can. Try moving your arms at the same time for momentum and balance, keeping them bent by your sides at 90-degree angles.
    -   Repeat for 30-60 seconds.![mature woman doing march in place on prosourcefit balance pad](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0916/1708/files/blog_image_3_FIT.jpg?v=1553896499)

  

4.  **Step-Ups**
    -   Stand on the floor with the balance pad on the floor in front of you.
    -   Carefully step onto the pad, then bring the other foot up to meet it.
    -   Hold this position for 1-2 seconds, maintaining balance, then step back down and repeat as many times as desired.![mature woman doing step up exercise on prosourcefit balance pad](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0916/1708/files/blog_image_2_FIT.jpg?v=1553896548)

5.  **Single Leg Balance**
    -   Start standing on the balance pad with feet close together.
    -   Extend arms out to the side for balance, then slowly lift one leg, bending at the knee. Try to raise it so your knee comes to hip level, parallel to the floor, or as high as you can.
    -   Hold as long as you can (up to 20 seconds), then return leg to the pad.
    -   Switch and repeat on the other leg. Repeat 5-10 times on each side.
    -   If this becomes too easy, try adding in some light dumbbells and performing bicep curls or shoulder raises while standing on one leg.

6.  **Squats**
    -   Start standing on the balance pad with feet approximately hip distance apart.
    -   Extend arms straight out in front of you, then slowly bend your knees and push your hips and buttocks back toward the wall behind you.
    -   Lower as far as you comfortably can, then return to the start position.
    -   Repeat 15-20 times.![mature woman doing squats on prosourcefit balance pad](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0916/1708/files/blog_image_8_FIT.jpg?v=1553896653)
7.  **Plank**
    -   Place balance pad on the floor, ideally on a cushioned exercise mat or carpet. Note: If you have trouble getting up and down from the floor, make sure the pad is near a counter, chair, or railing for assistance.
    -   Carefully lower yourself down to the floor into a kneeling position with the pad in front of you.
    -   Place bent arms onto the pad so that only your forearms and elbows touch, and elbows are aligned underneath shoulders. Extend legs back behind you and lift up onto your toes. If this is too difficult, you can remain in your knees.
    -   Make sure your body is in a straight line from shoulders to toes, not letting your hips lift up into the air or sink down toward the floor.
    -   Keep your belly button pulled in toward your spine and hold this position for 20-60 seconds, or as long as you can.
