Over the last few weeks, our team at Anaconda has been stunned by the rapid rise of generative AI and the unlimited applications that it can enable for people around the world. We believe that tools like these should be within reach of everyone, and that’s why we’ve worked hard to make Python accessible, flexible, and open. 

In this brief tutorial video, I show how to run run Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion through Anaconda to start generating images. See how to run Stable Diffusion on a CPU using Anaconda Project to automate conda environment setup and launch the Jupyter Notebook.

We'd love to hear about your experience with Stable Diffusion. Join the discussion here: [https://community.anaconda.cloud/t/running-stable-diffusion/47177](https://community.anaconda.cloud/t/running-stable-diffusion/47177)
